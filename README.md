# Gaussian_distribution
This is an python package used for Gaussian distribution Problems. You can Find the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution and can also plot the histogram.

## Distribuiton Package

Distribution is a python package used for Gaussian distribution

## Installation 

Use the package manager [pip] to install Distribution

in terminal type
<pip install aditya-distribution==0.1>

If you use python3 , type
<pip3 install aditya-distribution==0.1 >

# Usage
import Gaussian

gaussian_one(arg,arg)

""where arg=value passed""

# Returns Mean
gaussian_one.mean()

# Returns Standard Deviation
gasussian_one.stdev()

# To add two Gaussian distributions
gaussian_new=gaussian_one + gaussian_two

gaussian_new.mean => "Returns Mean of New Gaussian Distributions"

gaussian_new.stdev => "Returns Standard Deviation of New Gaussian Distributions"

# To plot histogram of Gaussian distribution
gaussian_one.plot_histrogram


gaussian_one.plot_histogram_pdf() =>"Plots histogram of Probability distribution function"
